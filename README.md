# APIs Weather Latitude Comparisons


VacationPy

The given Pandas code is a part of a project called VacationPy that involves using Pandas, APIs, and visualization tools to create an ideal itinerary for a vacation trip. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the code:

The first block of code imports necessary libraries, loads data from a CSV file, and displays a sample of the data using the head() method. It also sets up a map plot using the HvPlot library.
The second block of code filters the city data DataFrame to find cities with ideal weather conditions (i.e., cloudiness less than or equal to 40 and maximum temperature less than 25 degrees Celsius) and drops any rows with null values.
The third block of code creates a new DataFrame called hotel_df by copying the filtered data from the previous step and adding an empty column called "Hotel Name."
The fourth block of code iterates through the hotel_df DataFrame and uses the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of the city's coordinates. It stores the hotel name in the "Hotel Name" column of the hotel_df DataFrame. If no hotel is found, it sets the value to "No hotel found."
The fifth block of code adds the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map.
Overall, this code demonstrates how Pandas can be used to filter and manipulate data and how APIs can be used to extract information from external sources. The resulting map provides a visual representation of the itinerary for an ideal vacation trip.


WeatherPy


This code generates random geographic coordinates and a list of cities using the citipy library. Then, it uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the generated list of cities. Finally, it creates scatter plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude.

The script starts by importing the necessary modules such as pandas, numpy, requests, time, and matplotlib.pyplot. It also imports the OpenWeatherMap API key from a separate Python file called api_keys.py and the citipy library.

Next, the script generates a list of cities by using the citipy library. It creates a set of random latitude and longitude combinations and identifies the nearest city for each combination. The unique cities are added to a list called cities. The script then prints the total number of cities in the list.

After that, the script sets the base URL for the OpenWeatherMap API and defines an empty list called city_data to hold the weather data for each city. It then loops through all the cities in the list and fetches the weather data for each city using the API. It groups the cities in sets of 50 for logging purposes and prints the record and set numbers for each city being processed. If an error is experienced while fetching data for a city, the script skips that city.

Once the script has fetched the weather data for all the cities in the list, it converts the data into a Pandas DataFrame called city_data_df. It saves the data as a CSV file called cities.csv and reads the data from the file. Finally, it creates scatter plots to showcase the relationship between latitude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. The plots are saved as PNG files and displayed using the matplotlib.pyplot module.
